I couldn't find any solution for building zlib 1.2.7 in Visual Studio 2012 (express) so I created my own one.

PS: after you've cloned this repository don't forget to run

    git submodule init

and

    git submodule update
    
to initialize the `src` subrepository, which refers to github zlib repository.
